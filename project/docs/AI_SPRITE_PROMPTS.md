## 🔧 Post-Procesamiento

Después de generar los sprites:

1. **Redimensionar si es necesario**: A 64x64 exactos por frame
2. **Verificar transparencia**: Fondo completamente transparente
3. **Guardar como PNG**: En carpetas correspondientes
4. **Nombrar archivos**: `[animation_type].png` (ej: `flight.png`, `impact.png`)

### Estructura de carpetas:
```
assets/sprites/projectiles/
├── ice_wand/
│   ├── flight.png
│   └── impact.png
├── fire_wand/
│   ├── flight.png
│   └── impact.png
└── ... (cada arma)
```
