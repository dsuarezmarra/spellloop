### Impact Animation (6 frames)
```
Create a horizontal sprite strip of 6 frames (64x64 each = 384x64 total).
TOP-DOWN VIEW for 2D game. Black background (#000000).
Each frame CENTERED in its 64x64 cell. Content max 54x54px with 5px padding.

Subject: Fire tornado impact - explosive spiral burst with massive knockback

Design:
- Same palette: Orange (#FF6600), red-orange (#FF4400), yellow-white core (#FFEE66)

- Frame 2: Spiral explosion begins - flames shoot outward in CURVED paths (following spin)
- Frame 3: Maximum burst - spiral arms of fire expanding, wind visible
- Frame 4: Flames continuing outward in curved trajectories, embers everywhere
- Frame 5: Spiral arms dissipating, embers still flying in curves
- Frame 6: Final ember sparks curving away, smoke wisps fading

Key visual concept: Explosion follows SPIRAL pattern, not radial - flames curve as they fly out

Effects:
- Curved flame trails showing the spin momentum
- Wind burst lines in spiral pattern
- Embers flying in curved paths (tangential)
- Central heat flash
- Smoke/ash wisps spinning outward
- High-energy, violent dispersal feel
